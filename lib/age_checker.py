def age_checker(DOB):
    return DOB
    # Takes date of birth and checks if user is older than 16 



    # Returns:
    #     Boolean True/False if user is old enough

    # Side effects:
    #     Date is beyond present date, throw error
    #     Impossible DOB (far too old) 
    #     Formatting issues (ie day vs month, DD-MM-YYYY vs YYYY-MM-DD)
    #     If user is exactly 16
